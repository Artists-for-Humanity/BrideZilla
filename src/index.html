                    Welcome to Bridezilla. Your friend is now getting married and she asked you to be her bridesmaid yay
                    !! You decide to help her go shopping before the wedding, but there's one issue... You find out that
                    she is a Bridezilla. In the beginning of the game the bride shouts out a demand to the bridesmaid
                    who then has to run around to different stations depending on what the bride asked for. You must
                    complete tasks within a certain time frame and then return to the bride with the item.
                </p>

                    a game. coding can make an idea into something functional and fun. </p>
